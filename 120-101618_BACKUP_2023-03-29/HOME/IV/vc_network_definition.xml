<!-- vc_network_definition.xml

     This XML-file makes it possible to connect to a camera from a
     virtual controller. 
	 
	 This file is read at startup of the virtual controller. To take effect, 
     the file must be named vc_network_definition.xml and placed in the 
     HOME-directory of the virtual controller. 
     From RobotWare release 6.05 a copy of the file is placed in the HOME/IV directory 
     at startup of the virtual controller. The file could be placed in the HOME 
     or in the HOME/IV directory. The HOME directory precedes the HOME/IV directory. 
      
 	 Change the "SERVICE" IP address to the IP address of the PC network
     adapter that is connected to the camera.
